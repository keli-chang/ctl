Q(qualbut): You probably qualify as indigent but are able to contribute since you earn more than 150% of the poverty line. So you'll likely be assigned a lawyer and be asked to pay a small fee. See <a href="https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/hawaii/hi-statutes/hawaii_statutes_802-6" target=_new>HRS 802-6</a>.

See <a href="https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/hawaii/hi-statutes/hawaii_statutes_802-4" target=_new>HRS 802-4</a>. So you'll probably need to hire an attorney.
